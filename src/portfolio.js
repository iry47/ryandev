          "I spent 5 months living in a small French town called Champagny en Vanoise, collectively running a chalet complex with 5 other people. Growing up far from the mountains and choosing hockey as my primary winter sport, this was my first opportunity to indulge in snowboarding for a consecutive period of time - I even learned to love skiing as well! For anyone who loves to ski, this is an excellent way to make a bit of money while having an experience of a lifetime. However, organising it all can seem daunting and there‚Äôs a lot of hurtles in the way before you arrive: choosing a resort, finding a company/job and dealing with visas can all seem overwhelming, but like everything is just taking one step at a time! \n As much as I wish I could say I‚Äôve been to tons of resorts around the world, my experience is actually quite limited. Because of this I‚Äôm going to talk more about the resort I was at and what I learned, and hopefully the knowledge can help you in your quest!",
        dropdown:
          "My travels are rarely pre-organised or executed according to plan, and this was no exception. A friend and I realised in Barcelona how much we loved to snowboard and decided to embark on the mission of finding a job for the upcoming season. Having lived in England for half of her life, she was aware that it is very common for English families to pay an English company to organise their ski trip to the alps, including hosting them in an all-inclusive chalet. Therefore it is common for English people to work for English companies in the French alps. Perfect! She‚Äôs already English and me being Canadian can get a visa for the UK no problem. France is popular choice and bonus for me because I already speak the language. We began our search on the variety of English websites with job postings for seasons in France and started applying. A couple of the big sites we used and found helpful were : \n Many of the companies only accepted employees with EU nationality because, as I learned later on, visas become complicated for non EU citizens, working for a country outside of the Schengen zone but living inside the Schengen zone. In the end, our decision was entirely based on putting all our eggs into the one basket that appeared to have the best chance of working out, and it did !",

We had access to 141 chairlifts, 967 accomodation options, 475 runs to make up 425km of downhill skiing, 12 ski villages, 5 ski resorts, ‚Ä¶I think you get the picture. I really loved the ability to not only explore all the terrain during the day, but also come back to a smaller, authentic French resort that wasn‚Äôt filled with vacationers looking to party every single night. Champagny has 1 bar, 1 bar/restaurant, 6 hotels, 1 gondola‚Ä¶the opposite picture.

One of the six days was changeover day, spent almost entirely deep cleaning all the chalets and the seventh day (Wednesday) was completely off. We were able to ski everyday (minus changeover) from about 11-4, which is an average time that was shorter in the beginning of the season and longer after we ironed out the kinks of the job. The accommodation for the staff were private rooms for each couple ‚Äî the owner realised after several years that couples in the close-knit environment last longer and were generally happier throughout the season.

At the time of realising that the job hunt was serious and we were going to make it happen, I had been working in Barcelona with a Spanish visa and already booked a flight to Poland to begin a tour of eastern europe. So I ended up being a Canadian with a Spanish residency applying for an English visa in Warsaw but getting it sent to Budapest (where I planned to be around the time it would be sent). I still don‚Äôt fully understand the whole process, and if my Spanish residency affected my ability to apply for the visa outside of the UK, but point is to avoid finding yourself in a similar situation, and if you find yourself in the exact situation then you can rest assured that it is possible. \n\n Showing my visa to my employer was all I needed to be employed, placed in payroll and have everything set on the english side. Living in France, inside of the Schengen zone without a Schengen visa was a different story. There is another level of documentation that has to be done by you/your employer to post you in France.

Skiing requires such specific conditions and is hard for the average person to enjoy any day they‚Äôd like to, so if you love the sport then this is an easy, affordable way to make it happen.

While it‚Äôs rare to find hostels that offer everything you want and just how you like it, I very rarely leave a hostel dissatisfied with its service as a whole. When embarking on your first trip, hostels can seem intimidating and uncomfortable. I‚Äôve met many people who actively try to avoid them. I believe that everyone can benefit from staying in a hostel, and the only thing standing in your way is knowing where to look, what to look for and how to prepare for your stay. I‚Äôm not only going to look at hostels from the point of view of a guest, but also for people looking for volunteering opportunities. Over the years I‚Äôve accumulated a lot of experience on both sides of the hostel world, and I hope sharing my experience can make your life easier and maybe even persuade you to try it out!",

Most reservations don‚Äôt require a booking fee and often you can book without even using a credit card.",
        ],
        dropdown:
          "While in Europe I exclusively used HostelWorld. It was what I was initially recommended and pretty much the only site I ever heard anyone using. The UI is great and since everyone was using it, it was filled with options and reviews. When I got to South America I had to start using Booking.com after I noticed that HW was often lacking in options and sometimes didn‚Äôt have a single one, where Booking.com always came through. I also learned later on that I could book through Booking.com without paying for the reservation and the prices were sometimes cheaper than what I saw on HW. Whichever one you end up using, it may be nice to quickly check the other one before making a reservation just in case the price is different. When travelling during high season (it varies depending on location but school vacations are usually a good rule of thumb) it is best to reserve a couple days before because hostels tend to fill up, especially if you‚Äôre going to a party place for the weekend. Travelling during low season is the opposite and I almost never make reservations ‚Äî not saying there‚Äôs no risk of hostels filling up, you should do what you believe is best. You can call the hostel a few days before your planned arrival to ask how many beds are available the night you‚Äôre looking to book. I find that hostels often don‚Äôt list all the beds on these sites all at once. If I‚Äôm arriving early enough in the day, I prefer to choose an area that has a few options and go to visit each of them to pick out my favourite and negotiate prices. If I don‚Äôt feel like walking around (which happens after long days of travel) then I still wouldn‚Äôt reserve and keep the option of abandoning my first choice if it is really bad. After some trial an error you‚Äôll design your own system and in no time you‚Äôll be consistently pleased with hostels since you‚Äôve already set yourself up to arrive in a place that meet your basic requirements.

This doesn‚Äôt mean all hostels are bad, this just means you could have chosen better. I personally change the type of hostel I stay in depending on my mood of the day, whether I‚Äôm looking to work in a comfy common room, be really social and party or maybe I‚Äôm just looking find  the cheapest single room. When scrolling through a list of hostels, I like to have a couple basic filters to reduce the list. I personally always order by price, and then usually only look at hostels with breakfast included since I enjoy waking up with the first step of the day taken care of for me so I can focus on organising the day ahead. I also often have an idea of where I‚Äôd like the hostel to be located, and even if I don‚Äôt I still look at the map and judge its location based on points of interest like city centre, water, transportation, etc. Once you have your list of initial requirements set then you can take a quick look at the picture, rating and number of reviews before diving into the hostel‚Äôs page. There I usually glance at the description, but if in a rush the only important thing in my mind is reading the reviews. This is where you‚Äôll find out if what you‚Äôre seeing about the hostel is true, and what quality they offer. I‚Äôm usually looking for comments about the quality of the breakfast, wifi and environment, whether they have security lockers and everything else that catches my eye.

Having lived in England for half of her life, she was aware that it is very common for English families to pay an English company to organise their ski trip to the alps, including hosting them in an all-inclusive chalet. Therefore it is common for English people to work for English companies in the French alps. Perfect! She‚Äôs already English and me being Canadian can get a visa for the UK no problem. France is popular choice and bonus for me because I already speak the language. We began our search on the variety of English websites with job postings for seasons in France and started applying. A couple of the big sites we used and found helpful were : \n Many of the companies only accepted employees with EU nationality because, as I learned later on, visas become complicated for non EU citizens, working for a country outside of the Schengen zone but living inside the Schengen zone. In the end, our decision was entirely based on putting all our eggs into the one basket that appeared to have the best chance of working out, and it did !",

Arriving at my first Hidroviaria in Bel√©m, I was hardly surprised to find prices that were half those listed online and almost double the amount of departures times. The uniformed vendors throughout the station were immediately dropping from the listed price of R$340 to R$250 and in the end I paid R$170, which was an extremely low price and I actually received some unhappy reactions from passengers when checking into the boat. I also believe that prices change not only throughout the year and everyday leading up to your departure, but also depending on which hidroviaria you leave from: some locations (equivalently companies) seem more happy to bargain than others.",

While private rooms are available for two people at double the price each, the majority of people end up spending over 15h a day in their hammock ‚Äî a number I just made up, but I didn‚Äôt spend an abnormally large amount of time in my hammock and I easily got to 16h/day. I was actually gifted my hammock by a traveller that had just done the trip. The hammock was gifted to him and I gifted it to someone else, so keep your eyes peeled in hostels on your way there! Security on the boat is non-existant so it‚Äôs best to keep your things in sight or have them covered and tied down when there not. While saying this, my experience on the boat was nothing but positive: the majority of people on the boat are locals visiting family or friends and I often left bags in the company of new friends. The times to be vigilant are when people are entering and leaving the boat, whether that is at the port or when boats are attaching-on mid-river to sell food. I never had any trouble with the food on the boat, but some people did. I believe it helped that I had already spent so much time in the country and continent adjusting to the foreign bacteria. Minus the occasional soup or vegetable, the food is exclusively rice, beans, plain spaghetti and meat (usually chicken). I definitely suggest buying fruit and some tasty raw veggies before getting on the boat. I personally always bought water as well. Some boats have their water supplied by smaller boats which fill the tank with a hose: hard to believe is clean. While some boats bring in sealed 10L bottles of water and fill up the tank, there still no guarantee that the tanks are properly cleaned. Maybe I‚Äôm paranoid but I just feel more comfortable having trustworthy water while eating low nutritional food in a metal tank filled with hundreds of people cruising through the jungle. The boats always have chargers somewhere, and some more readily available than others. If you‚Äôre hoping to spend time in your hammock using your tech then I‚Äôd suggest getting a cheap extension cable and choosing your hammock location wisely. As a rule of thumb, never leave any device charging unattended. Even in boats with cameras and friendly looking people, it‚Äôs just too easy for someone to snatch it and never get caught. ",

Depending on the boat, the bathrooms might not even be in the same area as the hammocks, in which case you want to focus on being away from the footpaths and the entering sun from the windows. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask the crew, because they are usually pretty familiar with the trip! I found it really nice to get to know the crew and people on board not only for Portuguese practice, but also to know what is going on: planned stops, duration, when a suspected thief is on board, etc. If you don‚Äôt know Portuguese or Spanish (they are so similar that conversations are possible between unilingual speakers) then don‚Äôt be afraid to communicate through the international body language ‚Äî waving your hands and pointing at stuff! The first few days on the boat I was very paranoid about stops, staying in my hammock the entire time and waking up for every stop during the night. While I think this is an excellent way to prevent your things from getting robbed and avoid having a new neighbour above, below or too close to your hammock, it is kind of annoying and I quickly became more relaxed. My updated method was trying to find a neighbour that was staying around our hammocks to keep an eye on my big clothes bag that was tied down to the wooden pallet. With this friendly guard I left the boat with my small bag of important things and used the time to explore the city and usually hunt down some tasty a√ßai. Extremely important to talk to the crew and find out the estimated stop time, because the boat doesn‚Äôt wait for late travellers and losing your clothes, hammock and rest of the trip is far from ideal. Something I‚Äôve left for last but in my opinion the most important thing to do on the boat: watch the jungle! While things may look still, the amazon is always bursting with life and after days on the boat you‚Äôll definitely be able to see dolphins, a large variety of birds and if you‚Äôre lucky snakes, monkeys, sloths and more! I lucked out but if you can then try and do the trip against the current, or heading west. While this adds a bit more time to the trip, the boat cruises along side the coast where the current is weaker so you spend far more time with great views of the jungle!",

Boat rides can also be an awesome time of isolation, if you‚Äôre looking to work on a project or maybe get into a new habit like meditation. But whatever way you decide to spend your time, something on everyone‚Äôs list should be to take it all in. You‚Äôre cruising through the lungs of the planet, a place with one of the highest degrees of diversity in the world of not only animals but us humans as well. You have the ability to interact with communities that have only recently become aware of the rapidly changing modern society that is directly threatening this local diversity of life. One of the most frustrating things to see was the threat from the inside: the amount of people throwing plastics and garbage into the streets, river and jungle! While many of you reading this have been taught how wrong this is, I believe the Brazilian locals are showing a lack education not a lack of respect so be patient and you can try to talk to them peacefully about the damage they‚Äôre unknowingly causing. I was really able to learn a lot from the jungle: widen my perspective outside of the western mentality and see that we are far from having all the answers. There is not only one way to live life, and the path to world peace will only be achieved through the knowledge of every community. ",
